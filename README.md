# RPi CM3+ Tablet
Work in progress board for a tablet based on the RPi CM3+ module.

MVP is to make a small daughter board to plug into the official RPi 7in touchscreen.

Long-term goal is to make a complete swapout for the control board on the official RPi 7in touchscreen.

Both of these will hopefully have a built in 1S lithium charger with a 5V boost converter, speaker, WiFi, and bluetooth, and headphone jack.

Current design simply has the RPi CM3+ footprint with minimally connected power (without a 5V input to VBAT at the moment) and DSI port for the 7in display.

Will hopefully continue development when evaluation board comes in to do some hands-on testing before continuing with development.
